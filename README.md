Welcome to my github pages static website where I'll try to keep things short and sweet.
My goal for this repository / website is to have a place to talk about where I am today, where I came from, and how I got here.

I hope you enjoy my story.

### The U.S. Army

Before joining the military, I had done two semesters in college and just didn't know what I wanted to do. After some thought and reflection, I decided to join the Army in 2012 as a way of serving my country and myself. I served four years on Active duty from _2012 - May 2016_. I can honestly say my time in the military was one of the best experiences of my life. I am forever greatful for the friendships I made and the places I've been to and the skills I've learned.

Some of the places I've been to in my four years:
* Virginia, South Carolina for Training
* Natick, MA for 6 months temporary Duty
* Dongducheon, South Korea as my first permanent Duty Station
* Fort Bliss, Texas in El Paso
* Al-Asad, Iraq with my Texas unit
* Camp Behring, Kuwait

I loved the travelling, but as amazing as it was, I had no ambition to stay in forever. I grew as a person and wanted to challenge myself intellectually. I always knew about the incredible benefit of the GI Bill, and I started building out a five-year plan for myself during my final year in the military. Around the last year of the army I spoke with family and friends about potential options for my future; my brother introduced me to code and software development back in 2015. After researching into it more, it became clear to me that my interest wasn't forced - I was thoroughly enjoying the topics contained in computer science. 

### Transitioning and Gaining Traction

The end of my contract couldn't come at a more opportune time. I was applying to colleges in NYC while finishing the last few months in the Army in El Paso, Texas. I grew up in New York, born in Brooklyn and raised in the suburbs, I desperately wanted to drive for success - my goal was work and live in Manhattan.

Not only were my family and friends doing well in and around NYC, but the GI Bill had a great stipend for the area, too. I was so relieved and excited when I got into Fordham University under there Yellow Ribbon Program. I immediately started meeting other Veterans and being apart of their FVA (Fordham Veteran Assocation). 

After hammering out the details, I was separated from the Army on May 19th, 2016 - less than two weeks later, on May 31st, 2016, I was in a NYC classroom taking Structures of Computer Science CISC 1400 at Fordham University.

### Continuing School and Building Skills

It's been two years now, at first I thought college would be the only thing I need to succeed. I was getting great grades, always early to class, and having an overall greater appreciation for where I am and where I want to go. Except computer science demands a little extra. 

In January of 2017 I realized I need to be doing more on my own time in order to really become a confident, knowledgable 'Software Engineer'. That's when I started my in-parallel self-taught studies while taking upper level college courses. Since then I have taken courses on Udemy, Coursera, Zenva Acadamy, read countless articles, built github repositories in numerous languages, and more. 

This Summer (2018), I continued to take Summer courses are Fordham while also being apart of a small Brooklyn startup's software intern team. The company, Everlasting Wardrobe, supplies rental clothing to their clients for kids up to age 12. I was apart of their backend engineering team using the Ruby on Rails framework for their web application.

I am also in the middle of building a full-stack website for my buddies' podcast *_Throat Culture_*. They are on most of the platforms for podcasting and I've decided to be apart of it by making a Blog site which they can use to discuss topics with their users. It is in it's final stages, as I have done this myself, but I also plan on building a merchandise store for them on the site also. I can link that site when it finally goes live.

Currently I am heading into the Fall 2018 semester as my last semester. December of 2018 I will have my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from Fordham. 

But school won't end for me there, I've done the math and planned it all out - my GI Bill continues and so I've applied and been accepted to Fordham's Graduate program for M.S. in *Data Analytics*. 

### What's Next

I plan on having my M.S. in Data Analytics by December of 2019. With my veteran, collegiate, professional, and self-taught experience, I hope to be apart of a company that has great ideas and wants to build great software. When I graduate with my Master's, I would like to work as a Software Engineer for a few years, learning and growing my skillset.

My ultimate goal, however, is to specialize in Data Science - hence, the M.S. specializiation. I believe having the necessary experience in Software Engineering can help me to become a better Data Scientist down the road.

#### Preferred Tech Stack and Languages I've used:

I started with C++ when I first started Fordham more than 2 years ago. I also have used:

* Python - Wrote a webscraper with Python, I love this language. Big in data science!
* Ruby / Rails - Used at my Internship and my own personal projects.
* C++ - Most of my undergrad coursework is in C++, what a great language!
* Java - Created some programs with a GUI interface.
* JavaScript - I am currently working on a React and Node.js Course to deepend my JS skills
* HTML / CSS - Where would any good programmer be without these two?
* Always learning!
